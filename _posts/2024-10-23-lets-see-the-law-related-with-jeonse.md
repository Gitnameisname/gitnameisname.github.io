## Exploring Laws Related to Jeonse
While writing a post about Jeonse, I discovered that there is a section in the Civil Code dedicated to Jeonse rights. To study, I looked up the information on the National Law Information Center and pondered over this law. As an engineering student, I never thought about delving into the realm of liberal arts, but as I read through each line, I found it quite interesting.

The laws regarding Jeonse rights can be found in `Chapter 6 of the Civil Code on Jeonse Rights`. The Jeonse rights section spans from `Article 303 (Contents of Jeonse Rights)` to `Article 319 (Applicable Provisions)`. Upon reviewing these articles, I found several interesting points, which are summarized below.

*This post is written to study and understand the information I found. It is not a professional interpretation. For detailed legal matters, please consult a professional.*


1. **Article 312 (Duration of Jeonse Rights)**  
    According to Article 312 (Duration of Jeonse Rights), Jeonse rights cannot exceed 10 years. If you wish to contract for more than 10 years, it must be reduced to 10 years and then renewed. If Jeonse is set for less than a year, it is considered to be for one year, indicating that Jeonse rights should be set between one and ten years. If the Jeonse rights holder (tenant) does not receive a notice of renewal refusal or change in lease conditions from the Jeonse rights setter (landlord) between six months to one month before the expiration of the Jeonse rights, the Jeonse contract is considered to be maintained under the same conditions as before. However, in this case, the duration of the Jeonse rights is considered undefined. Can one live indefinitely under Jeonse? This can be understood from Article 313 (Notice of Termination of Jeonse Rights).

2. **Article 313 (Notice of Termination of Jeonse Rights)**  
    As mentioned earlier, if no notice/termination is given between six months to one month before the expiration of Jeonse, the previous Jeonse contract is considered extended without a defined duration. However, this does not mean that Jeonse can be maintained indefinitely. This article states that each party (landlord and tenant) can notify the other party of the termination of Jeonse rights at any time, and the Jeonse rights will be terminated six months after the other party receives this notice.

3. **Article 309 (Maintenance and Repair Obligations of Jeonse Rights Holder) and Article 316 (Restoration Obligations, Right to Demand Purchase)**  
    This section discusses the rights and obligations of the tenant (Jeonse rights holder). The Jeonse rights holder must maintain the condition of the leased property and perform repairs that fall under ordinary management (Article 309). Additionally, when the Jeonse rights expire and are terminated, the Jeonse rights holder (tenant) must restore the property to its original condition. There are also discussions related to the right to demand purchase, but as I am not familiar with legal terms, there are still parts that I do not fully understand.

4. **Article 318 (Right to Demand Auction by Jeonse Rights Holder)**  
    This article deals with the case where the Jeonse deposit is not returned on time. If the landlord (Jeonse rights setter) delays the return of the Jeonse deposit, the Jeonse rights holder can demand an auction of the property according to the Civil Execution Act. Let's ensure that the Jeonse deposit is returned on time.

Reading up to this, I wondered what tenants use to get Jeonse loans. Although I am not familiar with legal terms or texts, I thought I might find a hint in Article 306 (Transfer and Lease of Jeonse Rights).

5. **Article 306 (Transfer and Lease of Jeonse Rights)**  
    Jeonse rights are the rights to use the property (house). What comes to mind is an option. An option is a right that can be traded. If rights can be traded, can Jeonse rights also be traded? From this perspective, it seems that the Jeonse rights holder (tenant) can use these Jeonse rights as collateral to borrow money from a bank, which is what Jeonse deposit loans are. So, can the Jeonse rights holder (tenant) provide Jeonse rights as collateral? Article 306 (Transfer and Lease of Jeonse Rights) states: "The Jeonse rights holder can transfer or provide Jeonse rights as collateral to others and can sublease or lease the property to others within the duration of the Jeonse rights. However, this does not apply if prohibited by the establishment act." Therefore, the Jeonse rights holder (tenant) can provide Jeonse rights as collateral to the bank. Based on this, Jeonse deposit loans are made.

Additionally, to be protected under the Civil Code, a **Jeonse rights registration** must be done. This is another topic to look into.

There are various other legal provisions related to Jeonse rights in the Civil Code, which can be found on the National Law Information Center.
