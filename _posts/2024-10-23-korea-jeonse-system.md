## Jeonse System
In Korea's real estate rental system, there are mainly Jeonse and Wolse. The word Jeonse is the combination of korean character Jeon and Se. `Jeon` means transfer and `Se` means rent. At the Standard Dictionary of Korean, Jeonse means, "Deposit a certain amount of money(generally 50~70% of the real estate sale price) to the owner of real estate and borrowing that real estate for a certain period of time. Or that money. When returning real estate, you will receive back the full amount of money you deposited."  This post will focus on the Jeonse system. However, please note that I am not a legal expert and my understanding is based on general knowledge and searching. There may be inaccuracies or errors in my interpretation.

Let's see the definition of Jeonse at the Wikipedia. Jeonse or the right of Jeonse is:

> **The right of Jeonse(傳貰權)** is a unique real estate property right system in South Korea, similar to real estate leasing. When a Jeonse right is established, the Jeonse right holder (tenant) pays a certain amount of Jeonse money to the Jeonse right setter (property owner), and in return, the Jeonse right holder gains the right to use the property for a certain period. The compensation for this use is covered by the interest income from the Jeonse money paid to the Jeonse right setter. This system developed under the unique circumstances of housing shortages in Korea following the Korean War. Traditionally, Jeonse was a customary system combining elements of leasing and consumption loans, which the current Civil Law has formalized into a property right to strengthen usage rights.<br><br> According to legislators, there was a need to "grant proprietary effects to lease rights" and to "legalize the mutual loan practices of houses and money among the common people." The Jeonse right holds special significance as it legislates a system that developed within Korean society. According to the Civil Code, Jeonse right refers to the right to receive priority repayment of the Jeonse money from the property upon the termination of the Jeonse right, after paying the Jeonse money and using and benefiting from another's property according to its intended use. (Civil Code Article 303, Paragraph 1)

Here are the key points:
- The customary system of Jeonse rights has been legislated by the Civil Law.
- The compensation the property owner receives for offering Jeonse is the interest income from the Jeonse deposit.
- Terminology: Jeonse right setter (property owner), Jeonse right holder (tenant)

So, is Jeonse truly a unique system to Korea? The answer is "No". There are some similar systems exist in countries like Bolivia and India. Additionally, it has been found in ancient Mesopotamian civilization, the Napoleonic Code, and even mentioned in newspapers during the late Joseon Dynasty. However, in Korea, the Jeonse system became widely used after the Korean War during the industrialization process when people flocked to cities in search of jobs, leading to a surge in housing demand. When housing is scarce, prices naturally increase. Migrants to the cities often did not have large sums of money, and paying monthly rent, which was set at higher interest rates than banks, made it difficult to save money. Thus, a compromise was made where tenants provided a lump sum deposit, which was less than the cost of purchasing a house, to the landlord as collateral for a certain period in exchange for the right to use the property. During the high-growth period, simply depositing money in a bank could yield interest rates of over 10%, allowing landlords to receive steady monthly interest with relatively low risk. Although the IMF crisis later posed risks to banks, depositing money in banks was generally considered the safest investment method, barring such exceptional circumstances. In essence, the Jeonse system can be seen as a mutually beneficial arrangement between landlords and tenants.

### The history of Jeonse

According to the Encyclopedia of Korean Culture, we can learn about the origins and evolution of the Jeonse system. It appears that Korea's Jeonse system began after the 1876 Treaty of Ganghwa. At that time, the opening of three ports—Busan, Incheon, and Wonsan—and the establishment of Japanese settlements, along with the migration of rural populations, led to a rapid increase in Seoul's population, forming rental housing relationships. In the late Joseon Dynasty, Jeonse prices varied depending on whether the house was tiled or thatched. Typically, Jeonse was set at about half the house price, but in more expensive areas, it could reach 70-80% of the house price.(It is similar to the current Jeonse ratio for apartments.) The Jeonse period was generally set at one year, but sometimes no specific period was defined. The Jeonse system became fully established during the housing shortages exacerbated by the Korean War and the industrialization process.

Some argue that the Jeonse system evolved from the Goryeo Dynasty's mortgage system, which developed into the Gasa Jeonse system targeting housing during the Joseon Dynasty and into modern times. However, the Gasa Jeonse was merely a form of private finance where money was lent with housing as collateral, strictly different from the Jeonse system.
