## APT of Korea
Recently, the song "APT" by BLACKPINK's Rosé and Bruno Mars has become popular. In this post, we will explore what an apartment (APT) in South Korea is and why this type of housing is so popular.

As one of the housing types in Korea, apartments (APT, Apartment) hold a unique position. The definition of an apartment can be found in `Article 1 of the Enforcement Decree of the Building Act [Appendix 1] Types of Buildings by Use`, under section 2, item a of multi-family housing. According to this Enforcement Decree, an apartment is defined as `a type of multi-family housing with five or more floors used as residences`. In Korea, apartments are similar to condominiums in the United States, being privately owned units within a multi-family housing concept.

### 1. Popularity of Apartments in Korea
Why are apartments particularly popular in Korea? Apartments are standardized and built in large quantities, often by major construction companies with at least some building experience, ensuring a minimum level of quality. This makes it easier for both sellers and buyers to assess the value of an apartment. Moreover, branding strategies have been effective, and the specific apartment complex and neighborhood one lives in can serve as a status symbol. Additionally, with hundreds to thousands of households forming a single complex, apartments offer significant convenience in terms of complex management, waste separation, and security. Well-equipped community facilities also allow residents to meet most of their daily needs within the apartment complex.

#### A. Standardized Supply
Apartments are supplied as standardized large-scale residential areas. This makes them highly liquid and easy to price. Imagine there is an apartment complex with 1,000 households, and 400 of them are 84㎡ units. If 20 of these units are on the market, they will generally be priced similarly as `units of the same size within the same complex`. While there may be slight variations due to factors such as the building's orientation, floor preference, and sunlight exposure, the prices are still relatively consistent. This makes it easy to determine the price and evaluate the value of the property. In contrast, other types of housing in Korea, such as multi-family houses (commonly referred to as villas), are harder to assess. It is difficult to understand the internal structure, and even if the units have the same area, the materials used and construction quality can vary. Additionally, the market value of these properties can differ greatly depending on their age and maintenance status, making it challenging to determine if the listed price is appropriate.

Below is a look at the famous apartment complex `Gaepo Raemian Forest` in Gaepo-dong, Gangnam, as found on the Naver Real Estate website. This apartment complex was completed in 2020 and consists of a total of 2,296 households, making it a large-scale apartment complex. At the time the screenshot was taken, there were 245 properties listed for sale, 247 for jeonse (long-term lease), and 262 for monthly rent. The sale prices range from 1.95 billion to 4.5 billion KRW. You might wonder how this can be considered consistent pricing. However, as previously mentioned, the premise is that `if the properties are of the same size within the same complex`, the prices will be relatively consistent. To see this, we need to look at the listings by area within this apartment complex.

On Naver Real Estate, if we group the same listings and look only at the 86㎡ A type (627 households) and B type (67 households) in this complex, we can see the price range for the same size units as shown below. The prices are roughly between 2.2 billion and 2.4 billion KRW. Additionally, there are about 20 listings available, allowing buyers to choose based on specific conditions if they wish.

The neighborhood we looked at earlier is one of the most expensive real estate locations in Korea. Not all real estate in Korea is like this, so let's take a look at an apartment complex in Nowon, an outer district of Seoul. Below is the `Sanggye Jugong 10 Complex Apartment` in Nowon-gu, as found on the Naver Real Estate website. This complex has a total of 2,654 households, with 112 properties listed for sale, 35 for jeonse (long-term lease), and 26 for monthly rent. In this case, the apartment is located in Nowon-gu, an outer district of Seoul, and the apartment itself is 27 years old, so the prices range from 400 million to 800 million KRW.

Similarly, for this apartment, if we look at the 85㎡ A type (120 households) and B type (60 households) to see the price range, we can see that the listings are priced between 600 million and 700 million KRW.

On the other hand, it is very difficult to assess the price of multi-family houses (commonly referred to as villas). The number of units in a multi-family house is usually less than 20, and there may be only one or no listings available at all. Unlike apartments, which are built in large quantities, it is very challenging to evaluate the value of a multi-family house on the market. To make a comparison, you would need to look at similar houses in the vicinity, but these other properties may differ in age, internal structure, and construction quality. Considering all these factors to assess the value of the property you are viewing can be quite complex. If you misjudge the value, you might end up paying more than the actual worth, or you might find that the property is in poor condition after moving in.

### B. Convenience of Living
Korean apartments are also preferred for their high convenience in terms of living.

**1. Heating and Cooling**: Apartments generally have thicker walls and better insulation compared to other types of housing, which helps maintain effective heating and cooling.

**2. Maintenance**: With hundreds to thousands of households contributing, apartments operate management offices and security offices. This means you don't have to personally handle repairs or maintenance of common facilities like elevators. Waste separation and food waste disposal are also managed collectively, reducing concerns about odors due to the spacious complex.

**3. Security**: Apartments have security offices that conduct day and night patrols and manage entry and exit, providing relatively high security services.

**4. Parking**: Recently built apartments secure about 1.7 parking spaces per household. Most multi-family houses have insufficient and narrow parking spaces, often leading to disputes over parking issues.

**5. Amenities**: High-end apartments nowadays offer various services to residents, including gyms, swimming pools, theaters, and even sky lounges within the complex.
